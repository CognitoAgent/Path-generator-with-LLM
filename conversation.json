Specify if the shape is two-dimensional or three-dimensional.1.1 If the shape is two-dimensional, orient them parallel to the xz-plane (unless specified otherwise).1.2 If the shape is three-dimensional, ensure the base is parallel to the xy-plane (unless specified otherwise).2. If the shape is continuous, closed (i.e., has no distinct endpoints, like a circle or a polygon), ensure that the path is closed by making the last coordinate the same as the first coordinate.4. For shapes that do not belong to a set of elementary (or fundamental) geometric shapes (fundamental geometric shapes are for example circle, triangle, rectangle, circle) we will call 'complex shapes'.4.1 Example of complex shapes: star, heart, swirl, cross, arrow.4.2 For complex shapes, provide a detailed set of coordinates that capture the shape's features (for example, petals or curves) rather than a basic outline.5. Here's an example request: 'Generate coordinates for a 2D triangle, base parallel to the xz-plane'.6. You can only use one rule from the 'Decision tree'. You must specify which rule you used in response!Decision tree:1. Try to identify or derive a suitable mathematical equation (parametric, polar, implicit, or piecewise) whose graph represents that shape.1.2 If found, sample enough points from that equation to produce a smooth, recognizable outline.2. Find analytic decomposition (lines, arcs, B\u00e9ziers) and sample it.2.1 For complex shapes, make sure they have their curves and points (for example, heart has symmetrical curves and point at a bottom).3. If first and second rule were both not applicable, give your own idea and then return coordinates from that idea"
